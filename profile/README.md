<h2 align="center">The best way to experiment & explore with NFTs.</h2>

The Holaplex Hub provides a collection of loosely coupled microservices that make it easy to launch NFT campaigns, mint digital collectibles, run loyalty programs, and more. With Hub and developer APIs, no matter what industry you're in, you can explore the possibilities of NFTs.

## Getting Started

Visit our docs site at [https://docs.holaplex.dev](https://docs.holaplex.dev) to read useful guides and review our API reference.

## Services Catalogue

Hub is built on a shared [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/), which is a streaming data platform that is compatible with Kafka. Each of the services within the Hub has its own [GraphQL API](https://graphql.org/), which means that there are multiple APIs to interact with. However, these APIs are stitched together using the [Apollo Federated Router](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/) to form a single API endpoint. This makes it easier for developers to interact with the Hub without having to deal with multiple APIs separately. The use of the Redpanda cluster ensures that the messages emitted and processed by the Hub are reliable and scalable.

- [Hub Console](https://github.com/holaplex/hub) - A user-friendly management console for interacting with the Hub API.
- [Hub NFTs](https://github.com/holaplex/hub-nfts) -  Enables the minting and indexing of NFT campaigns on multiple blockchains, with support for cross-chain interoperability.
- [Hub Orgs](https://github.com/holaplex/hub-orgs) - Catalogs all organizations, projects, and memberships for the Hub, enabling easy management of your team and NFT campaigns.
